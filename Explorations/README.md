# Exploration 

Different materials have been used to investigate acoustic enhancement and to understand the relationship between sources, space and performative action. The initial focus was on understanding AAE systems and their influence on room acoustics, particularly through feedback processes. These explorations expanded with the use of multiple acoustic enhancement systems, incorporating complex signal processing to investigate spatial and timbral dynamics. Performative action became central to the exploration, leading to the use of the saxophone, analogue synthesis, and granular synthesis to establish a dynamic interplay between performer and space. Finally, these elements were developed into a cohesive compositional framework, embodying *space-action* and the reciprocal relationship between sound, space, and performance.

The recordings are presented in chronological order, and the title suggests the elements which have been explored.
