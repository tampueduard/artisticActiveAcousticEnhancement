## Abstract

Space has played a central role in the development of music, from the advent of polyphony to the spatial representations in electroacoustic and acousmatic music. Over the last century, methods for controlling and shaping room acoustics have advanced significantly. With the advent of Digital Signal Processing in the 1960s, Active Acoustics Enhancement (AAE) has emerged as an alternative to passive solutions for controlling room reverberation time. This technology can be used to investigate the relationships between space, composed material and performative action. 

This thesis conducts a practice-based inquiry into the use of AAE in electroacoustic music.  I aim to explore the influence of the perceived space on sound-making and on the performative act by establishing dynamic site-specificity through acoustic enhancement. This interaction tries to understand the boundaries between composition, performance, and environment by positioning space as an active participant in the creative process. 

The explorative work performed in this thesis resulted in the electroacoustic piece *Paradosso: for Alto Saxophone, Live Electronics, and Active Acoustics Enhancement*. This work relies on variable site-specificity and introduces *space-action*—a concept that describes the influence of perceived acoustics on the performative act—highlighting the potential of AAE to reshape the relationship between sound, space, and performance.
